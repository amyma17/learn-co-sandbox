            <p>Too informative. I took this quiz shortly after signing up for “Golden Oldies Bowling”. The quiz informed me that I was actually unhappy in my marriage, that I “used anger to hide my true emotions”, and that I “don’t believe I deserve love”.
            <br> I just wanted the quiz to affirm my decision to go bowling.

            <p>Too engaging. As a parent of 2 I was way to busy for most hobbies. The quiz recommended that I “find inner peace through painting” . By the time the transformation to “zen painter” was almost complete I had become a totally distant parent. I would drink the warm sun against my skin and paint the colors. I would bathe in whalesong and sketch the songs with oil on canvas. I would sing with the brings and eternalize our songs with a soft charcoal pencil. It was very fulfilling buy totally all consuming. After several months of painting the school called and said that I was being sued for neglect. Would not recommend. <br> ~Alice from New Castle, UK </p>

<p>I am writing the review on behalf of my ex-girlfriend, Miranda. Before we broke up the quiz recommended that she “take up canoeing”. Miranda and I don’t really talk much, but her instagram is overflowing with canoe pictures: Miranda canoeing with friends, Miranda at the Canoe Club, Miranda buying Canoe wax with her mother. Miranda and I each needed our own space, and it’s wonderful to see that her space is occupied with such a productive hobby.<br> ~ Bertha from Sydney, AUS</p>

<p>Oh man, words cannot express how wrong this quiz was. It recommend that I become “an adventurous epicurean” and that I “try new foods”. I took Gummi Bear Cleanse ASAP and boy was that a mistake.<br>
    Taste was good- 5 out of 5.<br>
    After effects were 100% negative. The gastrointestinal outcome of this cleanse totally outweighed  the taste. I was cramped, bloated, and bursting out both ends like a broken fire hydrant. I’ve had bad food poisoning before, but this time it was like the Mississippi river was flowing out of you-know-where.<br>
Quiz should give more specificity about what being “an adventurous epicurean” entails.<br>
